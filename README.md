# Predictive_Modeling_and_Interpretability_Techniques_for_SoC_Performance_with_Machine_Learning
This study introduces a machine learning model for predicting SoC performance, achieving high accuracy (RÂ²=0.98) with compactness and low latency. It uses autoencoders, feature selection, and SHAP for transparency, offering an efficient alternative to traditional benchmarking for unseen hardware.
